## Features

As far as this version release of my linter, this program will check the following issues:

    ‚Ä¢ opening and closing brackets
      
    ‚Ä¢ indentation: makes sure that code inside the brackets has a space of 4
    
    ‚Ä¢ checks code inside brackets follows colon and semi-colon rules
      
    ‚Ä¢ will throw an error if code does not follow basic linting rules: i.e keep code with now weird extra empty spaces
